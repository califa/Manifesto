# Design Manifesto of Joel Califa

## 1. Stress The Details
It is easy to rush before a deadline, or to get caught up in a multitude of features.  
In these cases, the details are not perfected and things are missed.  
I believe in incorporating a reductionistic approach within the design process and stressing every detail.  
Charles Eames said it first, "the details are not the details. They make the design."  

## 2. See The Big Picture
For others, it is easy to get caught up in the details.  
It's important to remember, though, that all the details in a project make up a whole.  
Without looking at a project holistically, individual parts may not work together as intended.  

## 3. Your Designs Are Not For You
Keep in mind who your project is for.  
Swallow your pride, passions and ambitions if they contradict with the needs of your users.  
Don't forget that everyone is a product of their environment. This creates biases and assumptions.  
Do your best to identify these assumptions. This will be good both for you, and for your designs.  

## 4. Always Delight
Design has the potential to create wonderful, human experiences.  
I believe every design, regardless of its field and context, can and should delight the people it touches.  
Delight is the hidden heuristic, never forget it.
